It is time to start using this data to answer a variety of questions related to my research and field. One of the most well known things in my field, is that perturbing Hsp90 function could affect the steady state levels of gene products (proteins) directly and indirectly.

Those that met our criteria were marked pink and those that did not meet our criteria were marked black or light green. To better visualize the 'barriers' for significance, red-dashed lines were added. Proteins with positive logFC values had decreased levels and those with negative logFC values had increased levels. Although not relevant for future analysis, we can spot proteins with large changes in steady state levels, but unfortunately did not meet our threshold for statistical significance (light green) and this is was due to too much variance between the 3 biological replicates in the measurement of that protein.\n",
