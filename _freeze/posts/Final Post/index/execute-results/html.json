Over the decades we come to realize this chaperone sits as a major hub of protein-protein interactions [@Gopinath2014; @Zhao2005a; @Rizzolo2019] in which it regulates the folding, activity, and degradation of its clients.\n\nThe current study expands the preliminary proteomic analysis previously done in yeast by us[@Hohrman2021], here we use quantitative proteomic analysis to compare extracts from yeast expressing wild-type yeast Hsp90 to nine different mutants. Our results demonstrate that the mutants elicit varied proteomic responses, even though the cells were harvested at temperatures that do not significantly affect growth. Overall, our results suggests:\n\n-   **cellular processes** that may be differentially affected by Hsc82 mutation.\n\n# Data\n\n## Significant hits in our Proteomic Data from DIA-MS\n\nData source:\n\n1.  Main data used in this analysis are the results of Data Independent Acquisition Mass Spectrometry (DIA-MS) experiments, a technique for quantitative proteomics. This is the crux of our study. For brevity, the data has been pre-filtered for significant hits of interest for analysis.\n\nA significant hit in our study is a protein whose abundance had a \\|Log~2~ Fold Change\\| (LogFC) greater than 1.5, relative to wild-type.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load in our data\nproteomic <- read.csv(\"trimmed_proteomic_Data.csv\")\nglimpse(proteomic)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 536\nColumns: 7\n$ Index         <int> 978, 1096, 1948, 2981, 3981, 4064, 4084, 4153, 4177, 590~\n$ Systemic.name <chr> \"YBR082C\", \"YBR102C\", \"YCL047C\", \"YDL181W\", \"YDR214W\", \"~\n$ contrast      <chr> \"A583T\", \"A583T\", \"A583T\", \"A583T\", \"A583T\", \"A583T\", \"A~\n$ UniprotID     <chr> \"P15731\", \"P38261\", \"P25576\", \"P01097\", \"Q12449\", \"Q0494~\n$ Gene          <chr> \"UBC4\", \"EXO84\", \"POF1\", \"INH1\", \"AHA1\", \"RTN1\", \"FMN1\",~\n$ logFC         <dbl> 2.800538, 1.707334, -5.045534, -1.636702, -1.893020, -1.~\n$ P.Value       <dbl> 1.777647e-03, 2.010339e-02, 3.890000e-05, 2.590000e-06, ~\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Proteomic Data Dictionary\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nproteomic.dictionary <- read.csv(\"Proteomic_data_dictionary.csv\")\nknitr::kable(proteomic.dictionary)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Attribute     |Description                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|:-------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|Index         |Old indexing from the original entire data set, artifact from \"write.csv\" function                                                                                              |\n|Systemic.name |Unique identifiers for genes in yeast                                                                                                                                           |\n|contrast      |Our single point mutations in Hsc82 isoform; This is sometimes referred to as our 'experimental conditions'                                                                     |\n|UniprotID     |Unique identifiers for genes                                                                                                                                                    |\n|Gene          |Gene symbol; symbols to genes by researchers and voted on by committees                                                                                                         |\n|logFC         |Log Fold Change in protein abundance in mutant sample over wild type sample; Log base 2; negative values signify increase in abundance, positive values is decreased abundance. |\n|P.Value       |corrected P value using Bonferroni correction                                                                                                                                   |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## List of Hsp90 Interactions\n\n2.

Our 9 different Hsc82 mutations\n2.  The top 5 most enriched cellular processes given by Gene Ontology Slim Mapper tool\n3.  86 different proteins/genes that were annotated to one or more of the top cellular processes *and* protein abundance was significantly affected in one or more Hsc82 mutants\n\nNode labels were removed for network clarity, with exception of mutant nodes. The GO process terms were moved to a legend and color was used to identify the GO terms in the figure. The focus of the figure was to identify potential processes, not individual proteins, that may be affected by one or more Hsc82 mutant, therefore labels for individual proteins were removed.\n\nNode colors were picked in consideration for color blind individuals using the \"Viridis\" color package.\n\nIn an effort to help reduce cognitive demand, the node shapes and sizes were adjusted to help visually separate the node classes and direct the viewer from the outer layer of the network, towards the center with increasing detail. Node shape for the mutations were removed and labels were left as the main focus of our study revolves around these mutations. The GO terms were designated as circles and size is larger compared to the individual proteins which were designated as squares. Overall, the increase in shape size moving outward from the center gives a sense of hierarchy of importance.\n\nBy focusing on the top 5 enriched GO processes, the classic hairball problem is avoided and we can show with visual clarity the cellular processes that would most likely be considered for follow-up experiments or studies.\n\n### EDGES\n\nGenes/proteins annotated to given GO terms by GO Slim mapper had edges drawn between the protein and the corresponding GO term(s). A few proteins, were annotated to more than one cellular process.\n\nEdges were drawn between proteins and Hsc82 mutations if the protein's abundance was significantly affected by an Hsc82 mutation. Some proteins were affected by more than one mutation and therefore have multiple edges.\n\n### LAYOUT\n\nAn initial network was made consisting of GO terms and proteins, after which the Fruchterman-Reingold force directed algorithm was employed and the GO term enrichments were used as edge weights.\n\nAfterwards, the Hsc82 mutant nodes were manually added around the perimeter of the initial network to avoid mutant nodes from influencing the force directed graph and avoid a network hairball.\n\n# Conclusions\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(g,\n     layout = rbind(layout, mutants[1:9,1:2]),\n     margin = -.8, # allow the network to use up more of the margin\n     vertex.label.cex = 1,\n     vertex.label.font = 2, # Bold\n     vertex.label.color= \"black\",\n     edge_arrow_mode = 0,\n     vertex.color = V(g)$color,\n     xlim=c(-5, 1.75), ylim=c(-2, 2) # Increase the plot size to help accommodate the network\n)\n\nlegend(\"topleft\", legend=unique(proteomic$Interaction), fill=unique(V(g)$color)[6:91], title = \"Hsp90 Interaction Type\", cex = .75)\n\nlegend(\"bottomleft\", legend= V(g)$name[1:5], title = \"GO Process\", cex = .75, pch = 21, pt.cex = 2, pt.bg = V(g)$color[1:5], pt.lwd = 0.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPreliminary network analysis reveals the cellular processes (Circle nodes) most likely affected by at least one Hsc82 mutation are related to metabolism and energy production, as well as stress responses such as oxidative and heat. When protein members of these cellular process that were affected in our study are examined, we can see that each process contains known physical (Yellow squares) and genetic (purple squares) interactors of Hsp90. The abundance of Hsp90 interactors in these processes builds confidence mutations in the chaperone are influencing these cellular process, likely through the interaction with the protein being altered, of which the protein may actually be a client, but follow-up studies would be required to determine client-hood.\n\nIn regards to individual mutants, W296A has the most edges or links to proteins involved in all 5 processes, suggesting this mutation is devastating to Hsp90 function and thus impacts the activity of these processes significantly. Although not shown here, the W296A mutation causes an extremely sick or slow growth phenotype in yeast compared to all the other mutants, thus it is perhaps unsurprising W296A has the most edges. \n\nR46G and G309S mutations were classified as \"loading\" mutants [@Hohrman2021], for reasons I won't explain here. Our current model of these mutations suggests that each group of mutants are affecting similar processes which cause similar observable phenotypes. Therefore, from the network analysis it seems that R46G and G309S mutations may both impact cellular amino acid metabolic process, but further studies are needed to confirm.\n\nSimilarly, the 'closing' mutants: S481Y and A583T may be selectively affecting the response to heat.\n\nThe 'Reopening' mutants: K102E, S25P, and Q380K do not appear to be affecting any one particular process as a group, except maybe response to oxidative stress.\n\nFinally, we have our 'miscellaneous' mutants: W296A and G424D. Of which, we already talked about W296A. G424D is in interesting mutation, but from prior studies, this mutation affect Hsp90 function, but according to our proteomic study (not shown here), only 11 proteins were affected in this yeast when this mutation is present. According to our network analysis, it might be worth looking into the cellular amino acid metabolic process with this mutation. However, it is possible the low number of protein hits in this mutant skewed the GO Slim analysis against it and an in depth analysis of this mutation only is in order.\n\nOverall, preliminary network analysis of our proteomic data suggests that some cellular processes maybe differentially affected by one or more mutations in Hsc82 and may be worth pursuing follow-up studies to validate these claims.\n",
