Over the decades we come to realize this chaperone sits as a major hub of protein-protein interactions (CITE GOPINATH) in which it regulates the folding, activity, and degradation of its clients.\n\nThe current study expands the proteomic analysis previously done by us (CITE GENETICS PAPER), here we use quantitative proteomic analysis to compare extracts from yeast expressing wild-type yeast Hsp90 to nine different mutants. Our results demonstrate that the mutants elicit varied proteomic responses, even though the cells were harvested at temperatures that do not significantly affect growth. Overall, these results suggest:\n\n1.  It is possible to selectively inhibit Hsp90 function *in vivo*, and\n\n2.  Identifies **cellular processes** and/or likely **clients** that may be differentially affected by Hsc82 mutation.\n\n# Data\n\nData source:\n\n1.  Main data used in this analysis are the results of Data Independent Acquisition Mass Spectrometry (DIA-MS) experiments, a technique for quantitative proteomics. This is the crux of our study. For brevity, the data has been pre-filtered for significant hits of interest for analysis.\n\n2.

However, we must also include our experimental variables, in this case single point mutations in the Hsp90 chaperone, this will help promote separation/clustering between nodes later when we apply our measurements from DIA-MS.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Visualize 350 nodes corresponding to the significant hits in our data\nnodes <- unique(c(proteomic$contrast, proteomic$Gene))\n\ng <- make_empty_graph()\ng <- add_vertices(g, length(nodes))\nV(g)$name <- nodes\n\nplot(g, \n     margin = -.4,\n     vertex.size = 4,\n     vertex.label.cex = .5\n     )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we must establish the relationship between these nodes. Starting with the relationship between our protein hits and experimental variables (Hsp90 mutants). These proteins were found to have a significant change in abundance when at least one mutant Hsp90 is expressed as the sole source of Hsp90.\n\n-   Color the edges of the protein-mutant relationship based on increase or decrease (green / red;consider color blind plebs though.)\n\n-   Edge thickness can be p value of measurement and/or\n\n-   edge color opacity/transparency for p value\n\n-   Edge length will be Log base 2 fold change; this will pull proteins nodes towards mutants that have significant impact on said protein\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nedges <- data.frame(\n  from = proteomic$Gene,\n  to = proteomic$contrast,\n  LogFC = proteomic$logFC,\n  p = proteomic$P.Value\n  \n)\n```\n:::",
