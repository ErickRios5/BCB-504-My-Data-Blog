This blog is intended to showcase my work as a graduate student involved in understanding the Hsp90 chaperone, it’s client-chaperone folding cycle, and client specificity. One of the main goals of my research is to selectively modulate Hsp90 chaperone function to selectively impace its downstream client targets by mutation or allosteric small molecule binders."

Those that met our criteria were marked pink and those that did not meet our criteria were marked black or light green. To better visualize the ‘barriers’ for significance, red-dashed lines were added. Proteins with positive logFC values had decreased levels and those with negative logFC values had increased levels. Although not relevant for future analysis, we can spot proteins with large changes in steady state levels, but unfortunately did not meet our threshold for statistical significance (light green) and this is was due to too much variance between the 3 biological replicates in the measurement of that protein."

The text in that section of your assignment should also briefly describe the data set you are using, especially the attributes used for the visualization.\nIn addition, make sure the visualization task actually requires the particular concept.\nFor example, don’t just make a scatterplot with one red dot for the Popout exercise.\nYou need to describe a task that requires we IDENTIFY that point.\n\n\nCode\nstack <- read.csv(\"2022-03-21_trim-stacked.csv\")\n\nhist(stack$logFC)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhist(stack$logFC, breaks = 100)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of figure 1 is to summarize the distribution of log fold changes observed across all mutant samples. A description of the results would be the majority of proteins detected and quantified did not have its steady-state levels impacted by at least one mutant condition. Using only this figure, it appears that only a small percentile of proteins detected had there steady-state levels impacted in at least one mutant condition.\nA limitation of histograms is it does not show the precise number of proteins with log fold changes between 1.5 and 1.7 for example. In an attempt to answer this pressing question, the second figure has an increased number of bins to narrow in the 1.5-1.7 log fold change region, but I still do not know the exact answer.\n\n\nCode\np350 <- read.csv(\"350_matrix_LogFC.csv\")\n\nplot(p350$R46G, p350$A583T)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncolors <- colorRampPalette(c(\"red\", \"blue\"))\n\np350$color.order <- findInterval(p350$A583T, sort(p350$A583T))\n\nplot(x = p350$R46G,\n     col = colors(nrow(p350))[p350$color.order])\n\n\n\n\n\ninstead of position, use saturation on y axis.\n\n\nCode\nplot(stack$logFC[stack$P.Value <= .055 & stack$contrast == \"WTHsc82_vs_R46G\"], \n     log(stack$Half.life[stack$P.Value <= .055 & stack$contrast == \"WTHsc82_vs_R46G\"]))"
