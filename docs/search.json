For the purposes of this exercise, let’s set the 2023 NHL draft order using the Tankathon Simulator. The NHL uses a lottery system in which the teams lowest in the standings have the highest odds of getting the first overall pick. I’ll simulate the lottery now…\nHOLY CRAP! The Vancouver Canucks jump up 6 spots, and will pick FIRST overall. Here is a screenshot:\n\nOur official scenario is this:\nVancouver receives: The 7th pick in the second round (39th overall), the 10th pick in the second round (42nd overall), and the 10th pick in the third round (74th overall).\nDetroit receives: The 1st pick in the first round (1st overall).\nDoofenschmirtz reasons that more draft picks are better, and is inclined to make the trade. Cassandra isn’t so sure…\nShe asks you to create some data visualizations she can show to her boss that might help him make the best decision."

Players get drafted when they are 18 years old, and they usually play in the juniors, minor leagues, or the NCAA for a bit to further develop. Let’s use a scatterplot to visualize this phenomenon with the most recent draft classes.\n\n\nCode\ndraft2022<-NHLDraft%>%\n  filter(draftyear==2022 & postdraft==0)\n\nggplot(draft2022, aes(x=round, y=NHLgames))+\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the players drafted in June of 2022 haven’t played much this season. There are few things wrong with this visualization, however:\n\nOverplotting. All those points on the y=0 line represent about 32 players each. Can you think of a way that adding extra channels might help?\nLabelling. Can we create a solid figure caption and better axis labels for this figure?

Can we change this to an ordered factor?\n\nIf one of the issues is the ability to distinguish between players (stacked data points), then why not separate by players? Also turn ‘round’ into a channel: shade/saturation.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(draft2022, aes(x= reorder(name, overall), y=NHLgames)) +\n  geom_point(aes(colour = as.factor(round)))+\n  xlab(\"Eager players\") + ylab(\"# games played in first year\")\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, there are too many names on the X-axis and this is due to 225 unique player’s name showing up. Maybe we should go back to focusing on the round they were picked, since our ultimate goal to visualize if round picks are a predictor of good performance or not. However, to resolve the issue of over plotting, we can try reduction (or derive?) of data. To keep things simple lets take the average games played by players in each round. That should ensure 1 data point for each round. You can’t have over plotting with only 1 data point per category!\n\n\nCode\nAve.column <- NULL\n\nfor(r in 1:7){\n  Average <- ave(draft2022$NHLgames[draft2022$round == r])[1]\n  Ave.column <- rbind(Ave.column, Average)\n}\n\nDF <- data.frame(Round = c(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\"),\n                 Average = Ave.column\n                 )\n\nggplot(DF, aes(x=Round, y=Average))+\n  geom_col()+\n  xlab(\"Rounds\") + ylab(\"Average # of first year games\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption: Interesting based on this plot/data, it appears that 1st round picks, on average, are more likely to play games in there first year.

I’ll eliminate all the players drafted in 2018 who never played an NHL game, leaving us 80 players drafted in that year who made “THE SHOW”. Let’s look at how those 80 players were drafted:\n\n\nCode\nplayedNHL2018 <- drafttot2018%>%\n  filter(totgames>0)\n\nggplot(playedNHL2018, aes(x = \"\", fill = factor(round))) +\n  geom_bar(width = 1) +\n  coord_polar(theta = \"y\")\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously this isn’t great, but can you state why? Write a little critique of this visualizaiton that:\n\nConsiders a player who played hundreds of games over their first five years vs a player who played one game in five years.\nEvaluates the relative value of a second round pick and a third round pick.\n\nNow let’s change this to account for the various years post draft:\n\n\nCode\nseasonplayedNHL2018 <- draft2018%>%\n  filter(NHLgames>0)\n\n\nggplot(seasonplayedNHL2018, aes(x = \"\", fill = factor(round))) +\n  geom_bar(width = 1) +\n  coord_polar(theta = \"y\")+\n  facet_wrap(~postdraft)\n\n\n\n\n\nSeems like there is something to work with here, but let’s compare this to a normalized bar chart:\n\n\nCode\nggplot(draft2018, aes(x = postdraft, y=NHLgames, fill=as.factor(round)))+\n  geom_col(position = \"fill\")\n\n\nWarning: Removed 218 rows containing missing values (geom_col).\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you work with this to make it a useful visualization for your friend, Cassandra Canuck?"

    "text": "Preamble\nPundits are tasked with providing unbiased reporting on new information, as it develops to inform their audiences, in order for society to adapt or adjust to the developing situation. To aid in this effort, many institutions or groups exist to aggregate data on various topics of interest such as gun violence and is often widely available for academics or internet sleuths to analyze, visualize, and interpret. The culmination of these efforts is often a report to answer pertinent questions to topics societies are concerned with.\nHere in the U.S. any citizen has the right to own firearms. However, the proliferation of firearms has many concerned on public safety and crimes committed with firearms. From your average Joe to politicians at the federal level, opinions differ on the threats posed and consequences of wide-spread availability of firearms, ability to conceal or openly carry a firearm. The the advent of social media has increased the flow of information and based on increased reporting of gun related crimes, the topic of firearms back into the forefront of average citizens and policy-makers. However, some people consider the increased reporting on crimes a product of increased flow of information and could mislead society and policy makers into believing crime, in particular gun crime is out of control.\nTherefore in an effort to inform those concerned on the topic of firearms, I will present and interpret the data set described below in an intuitive and discernible manner. One of the main overarching question(s) that will be addressed is:\n\nHas there been a significant increase gun violence?"

    "text": "Every time you create a figure, it needs a caption. The text in that section of your assignment should also briefly describe the data set you are using, especially the attributes used for the visualization.\nIn addition, make sure the visualization task actually requires the particular concept.\nFor example, don’t just make a scatterplot with one red dot for the Popout exercise.\nYou need to describe a task that requires we IDENTIFY that point.\n\n\nCode\nstack <- read.csv(\"2022-03-21_trim-stacked.csv\")\n\nhist(stack$logFC)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhist(stack$logFC, breaks = 1000)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of figure 1 is to summarize the distribution of log fold changes observed across all mutant samples. A description of the results would be the majority of proteins detected and quantified did not have its steady-state levels impacted by at least one mutant condition. Using only this figure, it appears that only a small percentile of proteins detected had there steady-state levels impacted in at least one mutant condition.\nA limitation of histograms is it does not show the precise number of proteins with log fold changes between 1.5 and 1.7 for example. In an attempt to answer this pressing question, the second figure has an increased number of bins to narrow in the 1.5-1.7 log fold change region, but I still do not know the exact answer.\n\n\nCode\np350 <- read.csv(\"350_matrix_LogFC.csv\")\n\nplot(p350$R46G, p350$A583T)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncolors <- colorRampPalette(c(\"red\", \"blue\"))\n\np350$color.order <- findInterval(p350$A583T, sort(p350$A583T))\n\nplot(x = p350$R46G[order(p350$R46G)],\n     col = colors(nrow(p350))[p350$color.order])\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of these figures is to display if these two mutants (R46G vs A583T) affect the same proteins/genes similarly, correlation suggests these mutants are doing similar things in vivo.\nInstead of position,I used hue for A583T mutant logFC numbers. Solid red is lowest LogFC in the A583T mutation, with purple representing Log FC numbers near zero (Wild-type levels) and Blue is the highest log FC values.\n\n\nCode\nplot(stack$logFC[stack$P.Value <= .055 & stack$contrast == \"WTHsc82_vs_R46G\"], \n     log(stack$Half.life[stack$P.Value <= .055 & stack$contrast == \"WTHsc82_vs_R46G\"]))"
