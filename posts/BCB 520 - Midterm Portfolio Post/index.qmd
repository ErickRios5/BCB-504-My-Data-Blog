## OVERVIEW

This midterm assignment I will be doing an exploratory analysis on gun violence in the US.

## Preamble

Pundits are tasked with providing unbiased reporting on new information, as it develops to inform their audiences, in order for society to adapt or adjust to the developing situation. To aid in this effort, many institutions or groups exist to aggregate data on various topics of interest such as gun violence and is often widely available for academics or internet sleuths to analyze, visualize, and interpret. The culmination of these efforts is often a report to answer pertinent questions to topics societies are concerned with.

Here in the U.S. any citizen has the right to own firearms. However, the proliferation of firearms has many concerned on public safety and crimes committed with firearms. From your average Joe to politicians at the federal level, opinions differ on the threats posed and consequences of wide-spread availability of firearms, ability to conceal or openly carry a firearm. The the advent of social media has increased the flow of information and based on increased reporting of gun related crimes, the topic of firearms back into the forefront of average citizens and policy-makers. However, some people consider the increased reporting on crimes a product of increased flow of information and could mislead society and policy makers into believing crime, in particular gun crime is out of control.

Therefore in an effort to inform those concerned on the topic of firearms, I will present and interpret the data set described below in an intuitive and discernible manner. One of the main overarching question(s) that will be addressed is:

1.  Has there been a significant increase gun violence?
2.  

## Data

Figures made and presented in this post will be based mainly on a U.S. Gun Violence Data set containing gun violence incidents, retrieved from Kaggle.com on 3/21/2023. However, the data set was originally collected from gunviolencearchive.org.

To help the reader understand the keys and attributes available in the data set, an example of the data is displayed and each column header is defined to ensure understanding what values and observations mean.

If any additional or supplemental data used in any visualizations will be mentioned in figure description.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
gundata <- read.csv("Gun violence data 1.csv")
glimpse(gundata)
gundata_attributes <- read.csv("Gun_violence_data_descriptions.csv")
knitr::kable(gundata_attributes)
```

## Visualizations
We are working with 1 key that identifies each separate gun incident, the dates when incidents occurred, and several position-type data where the incident takes place. 

Given we are interested in whether there has been an increase in gun violence/crimes within the recent years, it seems only natural to derive total the number of incidents for each year, across the US.

```{r}
gundata <- gundata %>%
  separate(Incident_Date, sep="/", into = c("month", "day", "year"))

total_by_year <- summarise(group_by(gundata, Year = year), Incidents = n())

ggplot(total_by_year, aes(x= Year, y= Incidents, group = 1)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point()

```
Interestingly, from the year 2014 there was an increase of gun incidents up until 2020, then there was a sharp decline in gun violence to levels less than 2014. Although all violence is tragic, fortunately not every incident results in casualties, but injuries or sometimes neither! Compared to 2014 the amount of gun violence appears to be dropping, but for the incidents that do occur: are more people dying, or getting injured? Lets have a look at whether there was an increase in either deaths, injuries or neither.

```{r}
Totals <- total_by_year

Both_by_year <- summarise(group_by(gundata[gundata$Killed == 1 & gundata$Injured == 1,], Year = year), Incidents = n())

Casualties_by_year <- summarise(group_by(gundata[gundata$Killed == 1 & gundata$Injured == 0,], Year = year), Incidents = n())

Injuries_by_year <- summarise(group_by(gundata[gundata$Killed == 0 & gundata$Injured == 1,], Year = year), Incidents = n())

neither_by_year <- summarise(group_by(gundata[gundata$Killed == 0 & gundata$Injured == 0,], Year = year), Incidents = n())


Totals <- bind_rows(Totals, Casualties_by_year, Injuries_by_year, neither_by_year, Both_by_year)
Totals$Type <- c(rep_len("Total Incidents", 9), rep("Death", 9), rep("Injured", 9), rep("Neither", 9), rep("Death and Injuries", 9))


ggplot(Totals, aes(x= Year, y= Incidents, group = Type, color = Type)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point()
```


```{r}
# test: use this as point size? instead of mean or median? 
Totals2 <- gundata %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(Total = sum(c(Killed, Injured)))

Casualties_by_year2 <- gundata %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(Total = sum(Killed))

Injuries_by_year2 <- gundata %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(Total = sum(Injured))

# neither_by_year <- summarise(group_by(gundata[gundata$Killed == 0 & gundata$Injured == 0,], Year = year), Incidents = n())
# 
# Both_by_year <- gundata %>% 
#   group_by(year) %>%
#   summarise(Total = sum(c(Killed, Injured)))

Totals2 <- bind_rows(Totals2, Casualties_by_year2, Injuries_by_year2)
Totals2$Type <- c(rep_len("Deaths and Injuries", 9), rep("Deaths", 9), rep("Injuries", 9))


ggplot(Totals2, aes(x= year, y= Total, group = Type, color = Type)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point()
```
This is interesting, but perhaps worrying as the data first suggested the U.S. was experiencing less gun violence nationwide. Despite, the total number of violent gun incidents drastically decreased between the years 2020 and 2022, to underneath 2014 levels. However, the amount of deaths and/or injuries per year increased, or at the very least stayed constant! The apparentw decrease in gun incidents is a result of non-casualty incidents decreasing.

It could suggest the likelihood of a death and/or injury occurring per incident is increasing each year, could we possibly reflect that by introducing a new channel like size of each point based on the average number of deaths and/or injuries per incident for each year?

```{r}
M_KIT_per_year <- gundata %>% # median of total killed and/or injured (including no casualty incidents)
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(c(Killed, Injured)))

M_K_per_year <- gundata %>% # Median of kills per year
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(Killed))

M_I_per_year <- gundata %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(Injured))

Neither <- rep(0, 9)

M_KI_per_year <- gundata %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(c(Killed, Injured)))

Mean <- c(M_KIT_per_year$mean, M_K_per_year$mean, M_I_per_year$mean, Neither, M_KI_per_year$mean)

Totals$Mean <- Mean

ggplot(Totals, aes(x= Year, y= Incidents, group = Type, color = Type)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point(aes(size = Mean)) +
  scale_size(range = c(1, 5), breaks = c(0, .50, .75))
```
