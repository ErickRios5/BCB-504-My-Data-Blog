Column names,Data.type,Attribute.type,Description
Systemic.name,Item,NA,Unique ID for gene
contrast,Attribute,Categorical,Pair-wise comparison between wild type and each yeast mutant
UniprotID,Item,NA,Unique ID for gene
Gene,Item,NA,Common name given to gene
logFC,Attribute,Quantitative,Relative protein abundance between mutant yeast to wildtype on log base 2 scale; negative values signify increase in abundance and positive values signify decrease in abundace
P.Value,Attribute,Quantitative,Stastical significance of measurements (3 biological replicates)
Length,Attribute,Quantitative,The number of amino acid residues in protein sequence
Mass,Attribute,Quantitative,the calculated mass of protein sequence
Hsc82_phys,Attribute,Quantitative,If it is known to physically interact with Hsc82 protein; 1 means physical interaction; 0 means no physical interaction
Gravy Score,Attribute,Quantitative,"Is a estimation of how hydrophobic a protein is overall, more positive equals more hydrophobic, but does not take into account 3D structure."
Half-life,Attribute,Quantitative,The time it takes in minutes for the cell to turn-over/degrade half the protein population
Instability Index,Attribute,Quantitative,"Estimation whether protein is stable in a test tube, values less than 40 are more stable than proteins with values greater than 40"
Protein-Abundance-Median-Absolute-Deviation,Attribute,Quantitative,Calculated estimate of protein molecules per cell
Aliphatic Index,Attribute,Quantitative,"The amount of volume occupied by aliphatic side chains such as Alanine, valine, isoleucine, and leucine; greater values may be indicative of thermostability."
